# Changing Focus

This repo is a university project for the class Information Visualization, a.y. 2023-2024, part of the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge Master's Degree program. 

The output of the project consists in:
- a [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falaimo99/infoviz/main/data/dataset_wikidata.csv) extracted from Wikidata, using its own SPARQL endpoint.
- a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/falaimo99/infoviz/blob/main/data/data_cleaning.ipynb) through which we explored, cleaned and prepared the data for the visualizations.
- a [website](https://falaimo99.github.io/infoviz/website/index.html), having as title "Changing Focus", that contains the Storytelling and Visualizations that we realized starting from our dataset.

Group members:
- Francesco Alaimo, as data extractor and analyst.
- Gaia Ortona, that took care of the visualizations.
- Chiara Parravici, responsible for the Storytelling and the Website design.
