# Changing Focus

This repo is a university project realized for the class of Information Visualization, a.y. 2023-2024, part of the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge Master's Degree program. 

The output of the project consists of:
- a [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falaimo99/infoviz/main/data/dataset_wikidata.csv) extracted from Wikidata, using its own [SPARQL endpoint](https://query.wikidata.org/).
- a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/falaimo99/infoviz/blob/main/data/data_cleaning.ipynb) through which we explored, cleaned and prepared the data in order to visualize them.
- a [website](https://falaimo99.github.io/infoviz/website/index.html), titled "Changing Focus", that contains the storytelling part and visualizations that we realized starting from our dataset.

Group members:
- Francesco Alaimo, as data extractor and analyst.
- Gaia Ortona, that took care of the visualizations.
- Chiara Parravicini, as Storytelling curator and web designer.
